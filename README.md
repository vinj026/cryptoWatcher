## What I Have Learned
During the development of this project, I have strengthened my understanding of:
- Vue 3 Composition API (`ref`, `onMounted`).
- Fetching data using `fetch` with async/await.
- Creating reusable Vue components.
- Handling API errors with try-catch.
- Applying conditional styles using scoped CSS.
- Designing a glassmorphism UI with `backdrop-filter`.
- Organizing components in a scalable folder structure.
